            <p>Every year we celebrate your birthday but we're the one who gets the presents which is the gift of having
                you in our lives. Personally, I know it doesn't get much lovelier than this anywhere else. My sisters and I are 
                 massively blessed to be your children and this is an opportunity we will never ever take for granted.

                As you get older, we pray that God continues to shine his light on you, keep you for us, protect you and bless 
                you with genuine happiness. We wish you a year filled with love, fullfilment, pleasant surprises and amazing health.
                I love you so much mum. Happy Birthday My Angel.
